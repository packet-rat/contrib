# Micro Use Cases
The Micro Use Case section of the [Community Contribution Repository](https://github.com/STIXProject/contrib) is a place for community members to view and contribute code which utilizes STIX data in common and useful ways. Our hope is that this will be a sort of recipe book for STIX developers wanting to represent and communicate specific forms of data in STIX.

Take a look at our [Micro Use Cases Wiki](https://github.com/STIXProject/contrib/wiki/Micro-Use-Cases) for more information about the Micro Use Cases and how to contribute!
